# Decision Tree Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python and scikit-learn.

## Files

- **decision tree.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code, explanations, and results for the Decision Tree Classifier.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```
3. Open `decision tree.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook decision\ tree.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells to see the implementation and results.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Visualization of the decision tree

## Results

The notebook provides step-by-step explanations and outputs, including model accuracy and a visualization of the trained decision tree.
